# JAva GUi for Applied Research (JAGUAR)

JAva GUi for Applied Research (JAGUAR) 2.1 provides a JAVA front end to DAKOTA, allowing for graphical problem set-up, execution, and viewing of results.  JAGUAR permits both text-based and mouse-click creation, editing, and execution of DAKOTA input decks. JAGUAR was developed as a graphical user interface (GUI) for earlier Dakota versions (circa 5.x, 6.x). 

Highlights:

-Synchronized autocompleting text and hierarchical graphical editors with error checking
-Cheatsheets to demonstrate the flow of creating an input deck from scratch
-Templates for the most common DAKOTA studies
-Sensitivity analysis wizard to quickly generate a screening study
-Ability to launch DAKOTA to check input decks or perform complete studies
-Help links to the DAKOTA reference manual for most keywords
-Automatic updating to work with your installed version of DAKOTA (5.0 or newer)
